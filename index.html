                        Quizznga is an annual inter-school quiz held in Bhubaneswar, Odisha. It was started in 2015 as an attempt  to fill the vacuum of quizzing in the state of Odisha. The quiz, in the last two editions, has attracted more than 300 participants from 15+ schools from across Odisha and some even from the neighbouring cities of Jamshedpur and Kolkata. The third edition of the quiz, Quizznga 2017, is all set to spread the joy of Quizzing this fall!
